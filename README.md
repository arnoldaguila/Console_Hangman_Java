# Console_Hangman
Java remake of my python console Hangman game. (Semi-complete just need to test more to find more bugs.)

Version 11/8/22

- Created Started on the Java version of my python Hangman_Console game.
- Created the ConsoleHangman class; getWord, blankLinesPrint, and hangmanPrint methods.
- Created win boolean to print a win or lose message.
- Found a bug for the inputs. It messes with the variable chances and the hangmanPrint method.
- Need to test for more bugs.
