# Console_Hangman
Remake of my console Hangman in python (Work in progress)

Version 11/8/22

- Created Started on the Java version of my python Hangman_Console game.
- Created the ConsoleHangman class; getWord, blankLinesPrint, and hangmanPrint methods.
- Created win boolean to print a win or lose message.
- Found a bug for the inputs. It messes with the variable chances and the hangmanPrint method.
- Need to test for more bugs.

Version 11/9/22

- Found created a base of the gallow to seperate the blank lines.
- Created a while loop to restart the entire program if the user wanted too
- Created boolean variables endSwitch, restartSwitch so the user can end the program early
or the user can restart the game if the user is losing.
- Created new if and else if for the purposes of ending the nested while loop to end the game or restart the game.
- Need to test for more bugs and features.
